# Bill Tracker

For my final project, I created a fully responsive website to help a user keep track of the bills that she/he needs to pay. The site allows users to add and save new bills to a list of bills. Each bill's name, amount, and due date can be edited and saved. Each bill can be saved after it is edited, or all of the bills that have been edited can be saved at once with the "Save All" button. Each bill can also be checked off as "Paid", which disables further editing of the bill. Bills can also be deleted from the list.

You will need MongoDB, Node.js, and npm installed to run this application.

To run the app:

1. Download the project from GitHub
2. Go to root directory of project
3. Run ‘npm install’ to install necessary packages
4. Run ‘mongod’ to start mongo service
5. Run ‘npm start’ to begin the app server process
6. Open a localhost windows to port 3000
